# Java Multicodec

## About Multiformats
Multicodec is part of the Multiformats collection of protocols.
Multiformats is a collection of protocols which aim to future-proof systems, today. They do this mainly by allowing
data to be self-describable.
See:
- https://github.com/multiformats/multiformats

## About Multicodec
The Multicodec is an agreed way for encoding bytes with a prefix that specifies the type of encoding.
The format is therefore a portable and self describing way of expressing an encoding of bytes that does not assume
a specific context.
See:
- https://github.com/multiformats/multicodec

### Examples
For example, the multicodec specification is used in the specifications for Decentralised Identifiers (DIDs) in
regard to the DID Method 'key' specification.
Therefore, any work on `did:key` implementations needs to also solve for the use of multicodecs.
See:
 - https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-method-key

### Why A Java Implementation?
It is noted that the [https://github.com/multiformats/multiformats](https://github.com/multiformats/multiformats)
lists technology implementations, however a java implementation is not available.
This library addresses that gap to provide an implementation of the multicodec specification in java.

### Dependencies
The code of a multicodec is encoded as unsigned varint as defined by
[multiformats/unsigned-varint](https://github.com/multiformats/unsigned-varint).
It is then used as a prefix to identify the data that follows. This represents some additional binary operations.

This project also solves for a java implementation of unsigned varints so may also be of use for implementors.

### Sample Usage
```
//Demonstrate the encode data as a ED25519 public key...
byte[] raw = getEd25519PublicKeyData();
byte[] multicodecEncoding = Multicodec.encode(Multicodec.Codec.ED25519_PUB, raw);

//Demonstate decoding...
Multicodec.Codec decodedCodec = null;
byte[] decodedByteData = null;
String decodedByteDataHex = null;
Object[] output = new Object[0];
try {
    output = Multicodec.decode(multicodecEncoding);
} catch (AmbiguousCodecEncodingException exAmbiguousCodecEncoding) {
    System.err.println(exAmbiguousCodecEncoding.getMessage());
}
if (output.length == 3) {
    decodedCodec = (Multicodec.Codec) output[0];
    decodedByteData = (byte[]) output[1];
    decodedByteDataHex = (String) output[2];
}
```

## Known Problems

### Clash of Codecs - Decoding
There are two basic classes of the codecs, single bytes codes (e.g `cidv1`(0x01), `sha2_256`(0x12)) and multibyte codecs
(e.g. `upd`(0x0111), `p256_pub`(0x1200)).

The way that the codec codes are configured it is possible to encode to them, but there are situations where it is not
possible to decode.

#### Example 1:

 1. Consider the sample data as hex: `0xA1E9D3D8EC`
 2. When it is multicodec `cidv1` encoded we have : `0xA1E9D3D8EC` --(`cidv1`)--> `0x01A1E9D3D8EC`
 3. When it is multicodec `upd` encoded we have   : `0xA1E9D3D8EC` --(`upd`)----> `0x0111A1E9D3D8EC`
 4. Notice that both encoded strings for different encoding types start with `0x01`. 
 5. Therefore, when comes to decoding the `udp` value `0x0111A1E9D3D8EC` it is not possible to determine if the string is
    1. `cidv1` encoded with data: `0x11A1E9D3D8EC`
    2. `upd` encoded with data: `0xA1E9D3D8EC`

#### Example 2:

Another example also applies to `sha2_256` and `p256_pub` encoding.
 1. When it is multicodec `sha2_256` encoded we have : `0xA1E9D3D8EC` --(`sha2_256`)--> `0x12A1E9D3D8EC`
 2. When it is multicodec `p256_pub` encoded we have : `0xA1E9D3D8EC` --(`p256_pub`)--> `0x1200A1E9D3D8EC`
 4. Notice that both encoded strings for different encoding types start with `0x12`.
 5. Therefore, when comes to decoding the `p256_pub` value `0x1200A1E9D3D8EC` it is not possible to determine if the string is
    1. `sha2_256` encoded with data: `0x00A1E9D3D8EC`
    2. `p256_pub` encoded with data: `0x1200A1E9D3D8EC`

#### Current Workarounds
The `Multicodec.decode()` method makes the assumption that the decoding only supports single byte codec codes, to prevent the "clash of codecs" issue from presenting itself.
This means that while `Multicodec.encode()` method can encode for any codec code, but the `Multicodec.decode()` does not support decoding of multibyte codec codes. 

If `Multicodec.decode()` is used to decode a multibyte codec code then `AmbiguousCodecEncodingException` is thrown. 


#### Possible Solutions
#### Solution A : Use of a reserved character delimiter
The bytes used in the codec prefix need to be unambigious. Pick a used reserved byte (e.g. `0x00`) and use as a delimiter between the codec code bytes and the data

##### Examples

| name     | code   | delimiter | sample data  | example encoding   | decoding [codec] [data]           |
|----------|--------|-----------|--------------|--------------------|-----------------------------------|
| `cidv1`    | `0x01`   | `0x00`      | `0xA1E9D3D8EC` | `0x0100A1E9D3D8EC`   | `0x` `[0100]`   `[A1E9D3D8EC]` -> `cidv1` |
| `upd`      | `0x0111` | `0x00`      | `0xA1E9D3D8EC` | `0x011100A1E9D3D8EC` | `0x` `[011100]` `[A1E9D3D8EC]` -> `udp`   |


##### Pros
- Codec prefixes are explicit and unambiguous
- Common simple rule applied across all codecs

##### Cons
- Breaking change for the in-use single byte codecs
- Relies on no codecs ending in the reserved byte (e.g. `0x00`), which is an implicit rule that is too easily broken for new codec additions.
- Any codec that ends in the reserved byte (e.g. `0x00`) must be reassigned to a value that does not. e.g. `p256_pub`(`0x1200`) must be reassigned.

##### Recommendation:
- Not recommended.
- This will break a number of existing implementations that assume single byte codec in order to optimise to a simple rule. 
- The optimisation is in favour of the newer multibyte codecs that are in a draft over single byte codecs that are in permanent state.

#### Solution B : Careful selection of codecs that avoids clashes
The bytes used in the codec prefix need to be unambigious. The multibyte codec values that are in draft need to be re-assigned so there is no possible clashes.

##### Pros
- Codec prefixes are explicit and unambiguous
- Non-breaking change for the in-use single byte codecs

##### Cons
- Any multibyte codec that clashes with a single byte codec must be reassigned to a value that does not clash. Large reassignment exercise of multibyte codecs
- Relies on an implicit subtle rule that is embedded into the codec selections. The rule will likely be broken for new codec additions that are unaware of the clashing issue.

##### Recommendation:
- Weakly viable, but not recommended. 
- Will result in a significant refactoring and bulk reassignment process for a significant proportion of the multibyte codecs.

#### Solution C : Use of a reserved character delimiter, but only for multibyte codecs
The bytes used in the codec prefix need to be unambiguous.
1. Pick an unused reserved byte (rb) (e.g. `0x00`) 
2. Create rule that allows single byte codecs, so long as they do not start with the reserved byte (`0x00`).
3. If a multiple byte codec is adopted then it must start and end with the reserved byte (`0x00`).

##### Examples

| name       | code     | reserved byte | sample data    | example encoding       | decoding: [rb?][codec][rb?] [data]                       |
|------------|----------|---------------|----------------|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| `cidv1`    | `0x01`   | n/a           | `0xA1E9D3D8EC` | `0x01A1E9D3D8EC`       | `0x` `[01]` `[A1E9D3D8EC]` -> `cidv1`                    |
| `sha2_256` | `0x12`   | n/a           | `0xA1E9D3D8EC` | `0x12A1E9D3D8EC`       | `0x` `[12]` `[A1E9D3D8EC]` -> `sha2_256`                 |
| `upd`      | `0x0111` | `0x00`        | `0xA1E9D3D8EC` | `0x00011100A1E9D3D8EC` | `0x` `[00]` `[0111]` `[00]` `[A1E9D3D8EC]` -> `udp`      |
| `p256_pub` | `0x1200` | `0x00`        | `0xA1E9D3D8EC` | `0x00120000A1E9D3D8EC` | `0x` `[00]` `[1200]` `[00]` `[A1E9D3D8EC]` -> `p256_pub` |


##### Pros
- Codec prefixes are explicit and unambiguous.
- Non-breaking change for the in-use single byte codecs.
- Does not rely on clever implicit rules to stagger codec selections that will be easily broken.
- Does not need a large reassignment exercise of the multibyte codecs.
- The impact is limited only to multibyte codecs, which are mostly in draft status.

##### Cons
- Any existing multibyte codecs implementations must adopt the rule.

##### Recommendation:
- Recommended as most viable.
- Does not break most permanent implementations. 
- Ring fences change to the more problematic multibyte codecs that are in draft.
